# AI-VOICE-ASISTANT
AI voice asistant built using python to perform various tasks which I was doing daily. Such as ckecking my mail, reading some news, some coding practice, listenig to music etc. just by saying some "trigerring" words.

Firstly, on startup, the assistant wishes good morning, good afternoon or good evening according to the current time.

It also tells the current time if asked.

When asked to open YouTube, YouTube Music, Gmail, Google or even Leetcode it opens the respectve websites in a new browser window.

When asked what is "something", it searches the statement on wikipedia and displays the first 3 sentences as the summary of the answer.

When asked to shut down, or I say good bye, the program closes itself.

//WILL ADD MORE FUNCTIONALITIES AND INFO LATER.
